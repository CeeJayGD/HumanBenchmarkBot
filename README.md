# HumanBenchmarkBot
A bot made to automate the human benchmark tests in real time

## Overview
This is a bot I made in python to automate playing the human benchmark test in real time, without using controlled browsers like selenium.
I am very new to python and this is one of my first projects, so the code may not be perfect. I mainly made this to practice making scripts like this.

## Installation
- Make sure you have python installed to your computer
- Open your terminal and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
- ***(IMPORTANT)*** You may need to install tesseract to use *number memory, verbal memory,* and *typing*.

## How to Use
Simply follow the instructions given in the terminal when you run the script and make sure your web browser is in fullscreen.
You will need to restart the script once you are done using the aim trainer, as I currently have not implemented a way to end it automatically.
