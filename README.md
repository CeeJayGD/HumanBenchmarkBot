# Human Benchmark Bot
A bot made to automate the human benchmark tests in real time (without using automated browsers).

## Overview
This is a bot I made in python to automate playing the human benchmark test in real time, without using controlled browsers like selenium.
I am very new to python and this is one of my first projects, so the code may not be perfect. I mainly made this to practice making scripts like this.

## Installation
- Make sure you have the latest version of python installed to your computer
- Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- ***(IMPORTANT)*** You may need to install tesseract to use *number memory, verbal memory,* and *typing*.

TesseractOCR download: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases

## How to Use
Simply follow the instructions given in the terminal when you run the script and make sure your web browser is in fullscreen.
You will need to restart the script once you are done using the aim trainer, as I currently have not implemented a way to end it automatically. 

## Stats
### Reaction Time
**30-70 ms**

### Aim Trainer
**~300ms** (still working to improve time)

### Number Memory
**Unfinished**
Currently under development, no guaranteed results yet. (Farthest I have gotten is 6)

### Typing Speed
**700 wpm** (scores may vary depending on computer processing speed)

some tests may be affected by computer processing speed and other uncontrollable variables.
